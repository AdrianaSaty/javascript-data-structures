# 389. Find the Difference

#hashtable #string
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

1. Count frequencies in original:
   - We loop through each character and track how many times it appears using an object charCount.
2. Compare with modified:
   - As we loop through modified, we:
   - Return the character immediately if it’s not found in charCount or its count is 0 (i.e., the new character).
   - Otherwise, decrease the count, since it’s matched. 3. The extra character is returned when it’s first detected.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {character}
 */
var findTheDifference = function (original, modified) {
  const charCount = {}

  for (let char of original) {
    charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1
  }

  for (let char of modified) {
    if (!charCount[char]) {
      return char
    } else {
      charCount[char]--
    }
  }
}
```
